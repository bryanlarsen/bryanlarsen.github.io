  Omega-3 is the latest health craze.  Unlike many previous health
crazes, this appears to be well founded scientifically: many studies have shown consistent, significant and widespread health benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Omega-3 is an
  <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid">
   Essential Fatty
Acid
  </a>
  .
There are 3 types of Omega-3 EFA’s.  There are 4 types of Omega-6
EFA’s.  Omega-9 is not an EFA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The body can convert between the three different types of Omega-3
EFA’s.  However, this uses the same mechanism that the body uses to
convert between the four different types of Omega-6 EFA’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, for optimum health, you may follow either of the following
two strategies.
 </p>
 <h1>
  Vegetarian Strategy
 </h1>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Ingest a sufficient amount of any type of Omega-3
  </li>
  <li>
   Ingest a sufficient amount of any type of Omega-6
  </li>
  <li>
   Ensure that the ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 stays in the range of
1:1 to 4:1
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  What is a sufficient amount?  A common recommendation is that 33% of
your calories come from fat, and that at least 10% of these calories
come from EFA’s.  At a 3:1 ratio and a 3000 calorie/day diet and 9
calories/gram, this works out to 8.3g of omega-6 and 2.8g of omega-3.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are the omega-3 and omega-6 contents of common oils:

 </p>
 <p>
  As you can see, canola oil is the only oil that has a healthy ratio of
omega-3 to omega-6.  For olive oil, a healthy ratio may be maintained
by adding 1 gram of flaxseed oil to every 8-40 grams of olive oil
used.  (If you use flaxseed gelcaps, that might easily be 10 gelcaps a
day!)
 </p>
 <p>
  These omega-3 values are for uncooked oils.  Using oil for frying
destroys most of the omega-3 in the oil.
 </p>
 <p>
  WARNING: a diet high in unsaturated fat and low in saturated fats has been linked with heart disease.  Adding a small amount of tropical or animal fats is also a good idea.
 </p>
 <h1>
  Omnivore Strategy
 </h1>
 <p>
  For most people, it is probably easier to ensure that they ingest a
sufficient amount of all 3 types of omega-3 rather than trying to
maintain an optimum omega-6/omega-3 balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Omega-3 from plant sources is primarily ALA.  Animals (including
humans) convert this into the other two forms: EPA &amp; DHA.  The
National Institute of Health recommended 650mg of DHA+EPA. (At least
200mg of each for a total of 650mg).  This corresponds to 4-5 servings
of fatty fish (tuna, salmon, mackeral, anchovies, herring, saury) a
week, or 5 omega-3 eggs per
  <em>
   day
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The health benefits of omega-3 exceed the health risks of mercury
exposure; however carefully read
  <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/2002/2002_41_e.html">
   these Health Canada
recommendations
  </a>
  .
To summarize:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   maximum 1 serving per week of shark, swordfish, fresh tuna or frozen
tuna
  </li>
  <li>
   maximum 4 servings per week of canned tuna
  </li>
  <li>
   prefer light tuna over white (albacore) tuna.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Cooking (especially frying) destabilizes Omega-3, so do not fry or
overcook your fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you don’t like fish, a typical omega-3 supplement based on fish oil
likely contains the recommended daily dose.  Look for molecularly
distilled oil to eliminate your mercury exposure.

  Whole Flaxseed versus Oil
 </h1>
 <p>
  You may read that whole flaxseed is preferable to its oil.  This is
due to the presence of lignan, a plant estrogen.  Lignan is a potent
anti-oxidant, so may reduce the risk of cancer.  However, hormones are
not benign; too much is quite possibly a bad thing.  Source:
