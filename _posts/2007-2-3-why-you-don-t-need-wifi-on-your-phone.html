  I own a Sharp Zaurus and a Palm Treo 650 along with a WiFi card for both.  I never use WiFi.  Here’s why.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are several scenarios where you think it’ll be useful to have WiFi on your phone, either for e-mail, browsing or VoIP.
 </p>
 <h4>
  At Home or Work
 </h4>
 <p>
  Once the novelty wears off, you will realize that the computer in the corner is much better suited for internet and e-mail usage.  If you want to curl up on the couch or wander the house doing chores while talking to your Mom via VoIP, add a $20 bluetooth dongle onto your computer, router or NSLU2 and use that instead; you’ll double your battery life.
 </p>
 <h4>
  At a Friend’s House
 </h4>
 <p>
  Most friends have computers they’ll let you borrow.  Extensive surfing or VoIP’ing is antisocial, you won’t be taking advantage of that as much as you think you will.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Out on the street
 </h4>
 <p>
  By the time you find a free, open WiFi hotspot, your battery will be dead.  GPRS is so much more reliable that once you hook it up, you’ll just end up using that instead.
 </p>
 <h4>
  On vacation
 </h4>
 <p>
  I spent two months in Europe and blogged every day for the entire trip using my Treo 650 and a bluetooth keyboard.  I brought along the WiFi adaptor and never used it because it was such a pain to find and connect to a hot spot.  Instead, I transferred articles from the Treo to computers in Internet Cafe’s via the SD card and a USB adaptor.
 </p>
 <h4>
  At a coffeeshop to work outside the office
 </h4>
 <p>
  A laptop is so much more usable that you’ll end up lugging the heavy thing to the coffeeshop rather than taking along just your phone.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Summary
 </h4>
 <p>
  WiFi is nice to have, but it shouldn’t significantly affect purchase decisions.  Don’t ignore beautiful phones like the Neo1973 or Treos just because they don’t have WiFi.
