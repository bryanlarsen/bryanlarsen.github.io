  We didn’t do much today – Bethany and I are both coming down with colds, so we aren’t too energetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  We spent several hours booking transportation, accomodation and activities for the next week.  New Zealand has a great network of tourist information sites that are very helpful booking these sorts of things.

 <p>
  Today was also a national holiday so the i-site was very busy and many stores were closed.  We were lucky and did find a silk double sleeping bag liner – we’ve been looking for one of those for years!
 </p>
 <p>
  We had one major piece of bad luck today – Bethany’s fancy new lens that she bought for the trip broke today while the camera stores were closed.  And today was the last time we’ll be in a major city for a while.  And the big advantage of this particular lens is that we’d only need one lens.
