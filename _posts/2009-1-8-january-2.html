  We didn’t do much today – Bethany and I are both coming down with colds, so we aren’t too energetic.
 </p>
 <p>
  We spent several hours booking transportation, accomodation and activities for the next week.  New Zealand has a great network of tourist information sites that are very helpful booking these sorts of things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today was also a national holiday so the i-site was very busy and many stores were closed.  We were lucky and did find a silk double sleeping bag liner – we’ve been looking for one of those for years!
 </p>
 <p>
  We had one major piece of bad luck today – Bethany’s fancy new lens that she bought for the trip broke today while the camera stores were closed.  And today was the last time we’ll be in a major city for a while.  And the big advantage of this particular lens is that we’d only need one lens.

     Oh no, colds and another trip with broken glass.  Hope you guys are feeling better and the lens is fixable.
