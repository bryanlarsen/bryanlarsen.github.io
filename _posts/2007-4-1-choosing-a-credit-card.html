title: Choosing a Credit Card

 <p>
  Bethany and I are encountering a large number of shared expenses, so
we decided that it’s probably a good idea to get a shared credit
card.  We both currently have 3 credit cards, two of which are
never/rarely used.  So the simple thing to do would be to get a
spousal card for one of the unused accounts.  Unfortunately, these
unused cards are sub-optimal for frequent use.
 </p>
 <p>
  We both pay off our bills in full every month; once every few years a
payment may be missed through carelessness.  So interest rate is not a
factor in credit card choice.  The primary factor is rewards and fee
levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve worked up a spreadsheet comparing the best credit cards from the
six different companies we currently have cards with.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hardest part of the task is to value each individual reward.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Rewards
 </h3>
 <p>
  The simplest rewards are the cashback programs.  They usually give you
$1 back for every $100 you spend.  A dollar is worth a dollar, right?
Not quite.  They limit you in two ways: they only give you your
rewards once a year, and you can lose all your rewards if
something happens to your card.  In my spreadsheet I’ve therefore
valued a cashback dollar at 98 cents to make up for the opportunity
costs of not having the dollar for an average of 6 months.  There’s
also a column in the table for “reward loss” because these programs
are often structured as “up to” X%.  This reward loss assumes that you
spend enough to reach the highest tier.  If you don’t, the card gets
overpenalized.  Penalizing a card for over-complication is fine with
me!
 </p>
 <p>
  Another common type of reward is store points.  For example, 1000
points can be “spent” at the store.  If this is a store you frequent,
one dollar of store credit is worth pretty much a dollar.  In fact, it
can be valued as worth more than a dollar since you often can take
advantage of special deals to get extra points.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this vein, I’ve valued PC Points from President’s Choice at par,
since I shop at Loblaws, Superstore and Hartman’s frequently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Petro points are harder to value.  I’ve used the 20000 points for $5
of gas deal for valuation.  This is slightly unfair since they do have
better deals in their catalog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Costco points have been heavily discounted because they require a
Costco membership and there is no Costco nearby.  If you shop at
Costco, they are likely worth well above par.
 </p>
 <p>
  TD points are nominally worth 1.5 cents per dollar on the card, but
I’ve discounted them heavily because they have to be spent at the TD
travel rewards web site, limiting the freedom to comparison shop when
booking flights, et cetera.
 </p>
 <p>
  With 40000 aeroplan points, you can fly anywhere in the United States
or Canada.  I’ve arbitrarily valued this at $400.  That’s probably
generous.  I’ve similarly valued Air Miles at 1600 points = $400.  I’m unsure about these calculations; if anybody has any input, please comment!  These valuations make it appear that the Air Miles offers are much better than the Aeroplan offers.  These change over time; when I did a similar valuation ten years ago, the results were reversed.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Benefits
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are a couple of optional benefits that are important to me.  The
first is the collision/damage waiver (CDW) for rental cars, which can save
lots of money if you rent cars, which we sometimes do.  This is usually
included with gold cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <span class="caps">
   AMEX
  </span>
  “front of the line” benefit may also be useful if you live in a
major city and go to shows.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other “gold card” benefits are less important to me.
 </p>
 <h3>
  The Cards
 </h3>
 <p>
  Bethany and I have each had exactly one instance where we wished to
use a Mastercard but the retailer only accepted Visa.  Therefore we
have a very slight preference for Visa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amex cards are less widely accepted and cannot be used without
carrying a Visa or Mastercard as backup.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Results
 </h3>
 <p>
  For our situation, here are the results:
 </p>
 <p>
  If you spend less than $8000 a year, President’s Choice is the winner,
followed very closely by
  <span class="caps">
   CITI
  </span>
  Enrich.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above $8000 a year, the winners are Amex cards.  This is unsurprising,
since they charge the merchants much more than the other cards do.
The only surprise is that their lead is so slight.  Air Miles cards
also do well, followed by the low price winners.

  I’ve attached
  <a href="/assets/2007/3/15/creditcards.ods">
   a spreadsheet
  </a>
  .  Download and change the annual spending
assumption and discount rates to your values and see what will work
for you!
  <a href="/assets/2007/3/15/creditcards.ods">
   The spreadsheet
  </a>
  is saved in the Open Document Format.  I’ve
also converted
  <a href="/assets/2007/3/15/creditcards.xls">
   it to Excel format
  </a>
  for those of you still locked into
Microsoft formats.  There’s also a
  <a href="/assets/2007/3/15/creditcards.pdf">
   pdf
  </a>
  , but I do recommend that you use the spreadsheet instead so you can play with the figures.

     Bryan, thanks for sharing your info, but of course in looking at the spreadsheet I want to know how my card stacks up… and it is zeroed?!  We use the
     <span class="caps">
      CIBC
     </span>
     Dividend Platinum.  I’ve not done as extensive research as you, but I do know that, for us, it comes up better than the PC card and the Costco Amex.
