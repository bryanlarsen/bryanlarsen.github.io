  I just made some porridge, and am waiting for Bethany to come so we can eat.

  One thing she didn’t talk about yesterday was the trails that we followed.  We were mainly following national cycle route number 12, which does not seem to be as popular as number 1.  For part of the route, it followed paved side roads, and for part of it, it followed an old railroad line.  A little slower than pavement, this was very nice.  The first few kilometres along the old tracks were actually grown over with grass; not quite enough traffic to keep the grass in check, but enough so that it was fairly hard and didn’t slow us down.  The other nice thing about the track along the old railroad was that the tree cover was closer; in the wind this was deeply appreciated!
