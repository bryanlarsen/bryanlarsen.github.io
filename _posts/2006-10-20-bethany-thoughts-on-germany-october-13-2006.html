  Now Bryan and I have definitely had huge appetites during this trip.  Not surprisising as we are exercising at a level a little above our usual.  I have always thought that European portion sizes are smaller than North American standards.  If this is the case I have not discovered it.  We have been more than satisfied despite our increased appetites.  Being a vegetarian in Germany must be a challenge.  Luckily I am not.  Meat/fish and potatoes is the typical fare.  Probably my favorite meal that I have had here was one that Bryan cooked over our stove.  It was just pasta, tomatoe sauce with a frozen veggie mix, and a spicy sausage but it was wonderful and simple.  Bryan likes the selection of desserts available in the bakeries here.  I yearn for a Danish bakery as I tend to prefer pastries to the cake varieties baked here.  At least I am over my wienerbrod cravings as my supply has run out.  Wine gums I have also weened myself from.  They are available here but Iâ€™ve moved on to sours and chocolate instead.  We tried a dark chocolate with cherry and chilli filling.  It was very good.

    HA!

My father&#39;s family is German and even tough I was born (and so was he, for that matter) in Colombia, my basic diet while growing up was meat (lots of it)and potatoes with a little Colombian addition: rice.  A regular meal would have at least one kind of meat but most likely, two or three.  I&#39;ve been trying -unsuccessfully or course, to become a vegetarian but my whole upbringing is so against me!
