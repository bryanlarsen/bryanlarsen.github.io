  We’ve been back from Europe for a while now.  I still have a few more articles about Europe that I’ve outlined but not yet written, I do hope to get to them sometime soon!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the meantime, I also hope to keep writing on other subjects.  I’ve created a few more sections, so if you are not interested in everything, you can unsubscribe from the main blog and subscribe to the sections you are interested in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not everybody will be interested in the Technical or Personal sections, but I would ask that everybody please subscribe to the Arguments section (or stay subscribed to the Home section, which will continue to include all of the articles).    I will try to keep those articles interesting and informative for everybody.
