  Pictures for the last 11 days have been uploaded.  Unlike this blog, we don’t have things set up to ration them out to you with a week’s delay.  So rather than overloading yourselves, I recommend that you just view the pictures one day at a time.  Go to
  <a href="http://bryan.larsen.st/2006/10/19/nordenham-october-12th-25km">
   our October 12th blog entry
  </a>
  and start viewing the pictures one day at a time.  No jumping ahead to days that don’t have a blog entry yet!
