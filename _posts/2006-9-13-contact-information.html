  Welcome to the first of my Europe 2006 journal entries!
 </p>
 <p>
  This is just some boring contact info.  It will get more interesting once I get to Europe, I promise!

  My flight leaves Ottawa at 22h30 Wednesday evening and arrives in Copenhagen at 16h55.

  I purchased a global SIM code for my phone.  The phone number is +44 7624 158199.   While I’m in Europe, it’s free for me to receive phone calls and to receive text messages.  However, voicemail is extremely expensive for me to access, so please don’t leave a message unless you really need to!  It’s also expensive to call back, so don’t expect immediate replies.
