  We’re enjoying reading the comments.  Hadn’t heard about the riots in Copenhagen; Bethany did notice a newspaper cover that looked a little weird, but we’re a little cut off from the world here, not being able to read Danish beyond a menu.  Of course, that’s on purpose, but…

  If you haven’t noticed by now, we’ve been composing our updates off-line and uploading them once or twice a week, and having the blog dole them out to you once a day.  For instance, right now we’re in Ferittslev, but you won’t hear about that for a while!  We can’t dole out the pictures, though, so that jumps ahead.

  [Note from wayne:] I’ve updated some of the entries to include maps, hopefully that’ll help those following along at home figure out where exactly they are!  (I know I’ve been confused!).  Oh, and the comment box should now be a reasonable size, so no excuses for not leaving a nice comment!

  Cheers,
