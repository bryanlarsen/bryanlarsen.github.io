   Linus&#39; endorsement of that review
  </a>
  , it seemed like a good time to move my noisy hard drives to the basement and switch to an flash based hard drive (AKA solid state drive: SSD).
 </p>
 <p>
  The 30GB Vertex SSD is currently CAD$ 160.   Getting anything other than the smallest one seems very silly - I assume that prices are going to drop like a rock, so it&#39;d be very painful to spend much more than that on anything that will be worthless in a year or two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily, Linux will fit very easily into 30GB.  The plan is to put just about everything except for the operating system and work onto the NFS server in the basement.
 </p>
 <p>
  The process did not go very smoothly at all.   I highly recommend staying away from the Vertex drives for a few months to let them mature.  But if you insist, here&#39;s the procedure I went through.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing I had to do was
  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelMainlineBuilds">
   upgrade my kernel to 2.6.29
  </a>
  .  The SSD worked for a little while, and then failed completely.  It appeared to work on an Intel based machine, but my AMD 780G machine was not happy at all.   I even went through the hassle of installing Windows XP to see if it worked there, but XP didn&#39;t even see the drive.  Note that my other machine appeared to work fine with the SSD, so I think it&#39;s sort of SB700/SSD interaction.  Others have reported issues on the forum as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing you&#39;ll probably want to do is a secure erase of the drive.  SSD&#39;s slow down as they&#39;re used, so starting fresh is essential.  Warning, this will completely erase any ATA drive, so make sure you have that drive letter right!
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   hdparm --security-erase NULL /dev/sda
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Following
  <a href="http://thunk.org/tytso/blog/2009/02/20/aligning-filesystems-to-an-ssds-erase-block-size/">
   Ted Tso&#39;s instructions on how to properly align the partitions for maximum speed
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   fdisk -H 224 -S 56 /dev/sda
# enter &#39;n, p, 1, 1, 5082&#39; at the prompts to create a partition covering the entire drive
# enter &#39;x, b, 1, 256, w&#39; to move the start of the partition into alignment
mke2fs -t ext4 -E stripe-width=32,resize=50G /dev/sda1
mkdir /mnt/ssd
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ssd
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Now follow
  <a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6149142.html">
   these instructions
  </a>
  to copy your operating system over to the new drive.  We&#39;re going to copy over everything except for /home/blarsen, which we&#39;re going to mount over NFS.
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ls / &gt; ~/root_files
vi ~/root_files  # remove proc, sys, mnt, home et cetera
tar --create --one-file-system --file - `cat ~/root_files` | (cd /mnt/ssd ; tar xvf -)
mkdir /mnt/ssd/proc
mkdir /mnt/ssd/sys
mkdir /mnt/ssd/mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/ssd/home/blarsen
chown blarsen.blarsen /mnt/ssd/home/blarsen
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Let&#39;s set up our fstab to nfs mount /home/blarsen, and run tmpfs on /tmp and /var/tmp.  The size parameter to tmpfs is a maximum size -- it doesn&#39;t use any RAM if it isn&#39;t needed.   The default is half your RAM, so you&#39;ll probably want to limit down a bit.
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   cat &gt; /mnt/ssd/etc/fstab
bulti:/home/blarsen     /home/blarsen           nfs             rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr,noatime,nodiratime 0 0
none    /tmp            tmpfs     size=500M,mode=777,auto      0       0
none    /var/tmp        tmpfs   size=500M,mode=777,auto       0       0
^D
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Change your root partition in fstab:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   blkid # to determine the UUID
vi /mnt/ssd/etc/fstab
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Now, update the grub menu.lst.   These instructions are missing from the tech republic link above.   You want to look for the kopt= and groot= option lines.  They look like comment lines, but they are actually instructions to update-grub.  While you&#39;re at it, add &#34;elevator=deadline&#34; to your kopt.
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   vi /mnt/ssd/boot/grub/menu.lst # update kopt, groot UUID&#39;s.  Also add elevator=deadline to kopt
chroot /mnt/ssd
update-grub
exit
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  And install grub on the new drive:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ssd /dev/sda
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Let&#39;s save our SSD by logging to our NFS server.   See these
  <a href="http://docs.sun.com/source/820-4893-11/chap_CF.html#50626577_57974">
   instructions from Sun
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   cat &gt;&gt; /mnt/ssd/etc/hosts
192.168.1.91 bulti loghost
^D
cat &gt;  /mnt/ssd/etc/syslog.conf
*.*;            @loghost
*.err;*.emerg   /var/log/messages
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  On your loghost, edit /etc/default/syslogd to add the &#34;-r&#34; option and restart sysklogd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Switch your network interface away from network-manager so it comes up earlier in your boot cycle:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   cat &gt;&gt; /mnt/ssd/etc/network/interfaces
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
^D
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  rsync your home directory to your NFS server.
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   rsync -av /home/blarsen/ bulti:/home/blarsen/  # those trailing slashes are important
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Reboot and enjoy!

     What’s your first impression?  The

     ’s look pretty good against a fast desktop drive. Put them up against a slow notebook drive, and it becomes pretty damn tempting. On the other hand though, 30GB isn’t really enough for a standalone drive. And the 80GB

     Hmmm, I can’t say I’ve noticed much.  The big win is on boot—Ubuntu boots faster than my
     <span class="caps">
      BIOS
     </span>
     does.  But my home directory is
     <span class="caps">
      NFS
     </span>
     mounted, so that’s slower, and counteracts my root and work directories being on
     <span class="caps">
      SSD
     </span>
     to a large degree.  The new machine has a faster processor and more
     <span class="caps">
      RAM
     </span>
     , so that contributes to extra speed.   But rails-dev-boost sped things up more than anything else!  :)

     P.S.  I think it’s time to kill feedburner.  Your comment never showed up on my feed.
