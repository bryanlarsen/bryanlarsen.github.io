title: Rogers dropping MSN messages?

  For the last month or so, communications between my fiancée and myself
over MSN have been unreliable.  It appeared that I received all of the
messages that my fiancée sent, but she did not get a few of the
messages I sent.  This was very aggravating, because there was no
notification that a problem occurred.  She just thought that I wasn’t
responding to her!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past I’ve had problems with dropped connections to various
instant messaging servers.  Those were annoying, but at least you knew
about it.  If the connection dropped, your client would tell you that
the message could not be delivered.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ve tried a couple of different AIM clients to try and fix the
problem.  However, it turns out that both of them use libgaim as their
back-end, so that is possibly the source of the problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there is also another potential source of the problem: my
ISP, Rogers.  Rogers is probably the largest Internet over Cable
provider in Canada, and employs packet-shaping devices to silently
drop encrypted bittorrent connections.  To identify normal bittorrent
packets, Rogers can use packet filters that identify the traffic as
bittorrent with near 100% certainty.  However, encrypted bittorrent
traffic is much more difficult to identify; to a third party observer,
the traffic is very similar to random noise.  Other encrypted and/or
compressed communications channels will seem very similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certainly there are signatures that might identify it as encrypted
bittorrent traffic, however it is much more like that “false
positives” might occur, and the packet filters might start interfering
with other services, such as my MSN.

   According to my dslreports

  , there may be
others with the same problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  I may be able to live without bittorrent; there are other ways of
downloading ubuntu ISO’s.  However, if I cannot be sure that other
services I rely on are unaffected, I am forced to switch internet
providers.  I have begun this process; I highly recommend that all
other customers of Rogers also do the same.
