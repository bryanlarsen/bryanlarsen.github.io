  Bethany and I were sitting around talking about pennies.  The way she phrased a comment made me realize something:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   We don’t need a government mandate to get rid of pennies.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This can be done at the grassroots level, and it would benefit both consumers and retailers.  All that would be required is that if a retailer owes you a few pennies in change, they give you a nickel instead.  A lot of them occasionally do that already, but why don’t they always do it, program it into their till, and advertise it?
 </p>
 <p>
  I know that a store with a sign saying “No pennies here: we always round down to the nickel.” or “No pennies here: any time we owe you one or several pennies in change, we’ll give you a nickel instead!” will score karma with me.  Goodwill for the price of 0-4 cents on every cash purchase?  Stores pay a lot more than that for goodwill!
 </p>
 <p>
  If you use a credit card or a debit card, they’d still charge full price, but when you pay in cash, they’d knock 0-4 cents off the final bill to make it an even multiple of 5 cents.
 </p>
 <p>
  And once somebody’s doing it there’d be pressure on other stores to do it.  It’s a cheap way to make customers happy.  And happy customers are repeat customers.
