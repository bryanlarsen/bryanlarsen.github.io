  Yesterday was a rest day.  Bethany’s knee was starting to bother her, so the timing was good.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing we did after porridge and a shower was to walk into town and pick up my new glasses …
 </p>
 <p>
  Which weren’t there.  Come back tomorrow.

  The library was our next stop; they have free internet for public use there; very nice.   We hung out there for a couple of hours and caught up on things and updated the blog a bit.  We added some images, but that was mostly Wayne’s work.  Thanks, Wayne!
 </p>
 <p>
  We then headed back to the centrum where I purchased a book, we purchased some groceries and then caught a movie.  Boring, I know, but every once in a while you need a day of rest and relaxation.

 <p>
  This morning, after finishing my book, we once again headed into town to pick up my new glasses …

  To find the lenses reversed.  They put the left lens on my right eye and vice versa.  We will have to wait another week!

  In a couple of hours, Bethany’s cousin Annette is going to pick us up and we’ll spend about 24 hours with her before continuing our journey.
