  I imagine that most of you know this by now, but I proposed to Bethany on Christmas Eve, and she accepted!  We are going to be married in Saskatoon sometime after harvest is over.

    Wow..so this is what happens when you don&#39;t get a chance to read someone&#39;s blog very often.  Congratulations to you both.  Bryan, I am so pleased that you have found someone special, and expect that after the test of travelling together, marriage will be a breeze!
