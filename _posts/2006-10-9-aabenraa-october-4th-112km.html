  What a fabulous day for cycling.  Thunderclouds swirled around us for most of the morning and early afternoon, but in the main avoided us.

  Southerly winds prevail here in Denmark, it appears, but today we were blessed with a moderate north-west wind at our backs.  We didn’t exect to make it to Aabenraa today, but we did.  Of course, it was dark by the time we got here, but we’re becoming distressingly familiar with the routine of finding a campground and setting up or tent at night.

  Along the route we encountered many farmers mulching up corn for silage, as well as a couple harvesting potatoes.  The silage wagons left plenty of mud on the roads for our bike s to bounce over!

  Tomorrow hopefully marks the end of the glasses saga; they should be ready for pick up downtown.
