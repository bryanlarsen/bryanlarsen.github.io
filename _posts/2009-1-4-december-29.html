  December 29 – Bryan from Lauder
 </p>
 <p>
  I woke up this morning feeling pretty good.  I guess it was a 24 hour bug.  After a good sized breakfast we headed out to collect our bicycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had rented a tandem.  We figured that a 150km ride over 3 days would be a good test of a tandem – we’ve been thinking about buying one.  It’ll be harder for Bethany than for me – she has to give up control and learn to trust me.  On a tandem, generally you want the largest person on the front.
 </p>
 <p>
  The railway was built in 28 years starting in 1879, and moved a lot of sheep in its day.  In 1962 one station loaded almost 200 000 sheep.  It was converted to a trail in 1991.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our first day consisted of 44 kilometers from Clyde to Lauder, mostly uphill.  The grade was never too bad, but we did have one section with a long looping 2 percent grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tandem was a lot slower than we expected.  There were many factors contributing:  it was a cheap rental and fairly bouncy, Bethany wasn’t pushing hard because of her hip, it’s been a while since we’ve done a lot of cycling, the road was covered with coarse gravel, we had a stiff headwind for part of it, and I crashed hard about halfway through.  I probably dehydrated fairly badly yesterday and had very little to eat.  I probably drank 5 litres of liquid on the trail, but it takes time to recover.

  It was very hot (29 degrees) and dry today.  This region only receives 300 mm of rain a year.  Hopefully it will be a little cooler tomorrow.  We may go curling to cool off.
