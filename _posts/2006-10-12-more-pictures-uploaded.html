  We’ve uploaded a lot of new pictures, and put captions on many of them.  Of course, we don’t have a lot of time, so sometimes we ended up with captions like “town in Denmark”.  The maps feature of flickr wasn’t working, so that hasn’t been updated.

  A good way to look at the pictures is to use the

   calendar feature of flickr

    Good, the camera isn't broken, and neither are the glasses!  I've been using google to track  your journey.  Billund to Aabenraa is 98 km, and should take less than 2 hours.  What do you do all day?
