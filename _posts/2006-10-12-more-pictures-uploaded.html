  We’ve uploaded a lot of new pictures, and put captions on many of them.  Of course, we don’t have a lot of time, so sometimes we ended up with captions like “town in Denmark”.  The maps feature of flickr wasn’t working, so that hasn’t been updated.

  A good way to look at the pictures is to use the

   calendar feature of flickr
