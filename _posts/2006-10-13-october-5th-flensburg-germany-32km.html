  We were starting to get comfortable in Denmark.  We had our routines down, we knew how to get around, we knew enough of the language to read a menu and the street signs.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now we’re in Germany.  My German is pretty much limited to what the soldiers yelled out in Wolfenstein 3D, and Bethany’s isn’t any better.  We picked up a cycling map for the Holstein-Schlesswig area in Copenhagen, but that doesn’t help you much if you can’t read the legend!
 </p>
 <p>
  Awful weather for cycling today.  Completely overcast with a strong wind, and drizzling for much of the journey.  So rather than taking the scenic cycle route, we took the one that follows the major road.  This made the journey worse, because of all the cars and trucks wizzing past, but at least it made it shorter.
 </p>
 <p>
  We grabbed a hotel room tonight.  We’ve tented 5 nights in a row now, and it’s rained every single night.  Things are relatively dry due to the liberal use of the clothes dryer in Aabenraa, but there are still a few things that could use some airing out.  Our tour books are starting to grow.  The worst ones were our Danish maps and camping guide, but those have hit the garbage can; no need to lug those around the rest of our journey!
 </p>
 <p>
  Wayne emailed us to tell us that Easycruise had some last-minute specials available: 39 Euros a night for a double room with a window.  We decided to take them up on that to break up our vacation and routine a bit.  So we’re leaving Amsterdam on the 20th and returning on the 26th.  Which means we have to actually get to Amterdam by the 20th.  Shouldn’t be a problem, but given our history…
 </p>
 <p>
  We were actually supposed to be in Amsterdam by now, given our original schedule.  We always knew that it was a little bit aggressive, and would have to use the train for part of our journey, but now we’re going to have to use it for a lot of our journey.  So far we’ve done about 1100 kilometres in 3 weeks out of a total of 9.  Granted we spent several days with relatives and chasing down glasses, but that doesn’t account for many kilometres.  The total journey is about 4400 kilometres, as a car drives.  The scenic cycle routes we use are significantly longer, but so much more interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the major reasons we’re in a hotel room now (besides the cold and wet) is becaue we have no idea whether the campgrounds are open.  We had a good book in Denmark which told us which campgrounds were open in October and which closed in September or August.  I suppose we’ll have to track down some internet tomorrow morning to find that information for Germany.  At least our Schlesswig-Holstein cycling map tells us where they are.
 </p>
 <p>
  While cycling today, I found myself cocking my head up or to the side to look around the cracks in my lens, which are no longer there!  I wonder how long it will take to lose that habit!

    Well, there you start another chapter of your trip. Sounds like soo much fun! If you guys need a place to stay or anything in Amsterdam I have a close friend there! Make sure you try some umbitekook (not sur that's how it's writen), it's a "breakfest bread" really very good. Take care!

    HAHAHAHA

Yeah, habits are difficult to break.  I recently (about two weeks ago) changed the lay out of the bedroom and I still find myself going to the other side of the room to grab a pair of sock or whatever.... where the dresser used to be!!!!  :P
