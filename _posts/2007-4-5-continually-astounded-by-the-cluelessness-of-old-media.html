  Two of the stories in the Ottawa citizen reference popular YouTube videos.  I’d seen the funny
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W91sqAs-_-g">
   Alanis Morissette sendup of My Humps
  </a>
  .  But they also had a story about
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpZsiDAJ01k">
   this video from Montreal
  </a>
  .   It sounded interesting, so I decided I wanted to watch it.  It took me about 6 tries typing in names from the video into the Youtube search box until I found it.  I finally gave up on that and searched for mégots.  That got it.
